/**
 * Usage database
 *
 * To get a better sense of how much load we're putting on botsin.space, we need to save some usage
 * data. This module
 * 1. creates and loads a simple SQLite database,
 * 2. exports a few functions that the bot can call to indicate when its hitting a certain endpoint,
 * 3. and finally, every few minutes, it'll dump aggregated data to the database.
 *
 * We are tracking:
 * 1. deletes because when we get a delete notification, we hit a REST endpoint to get the last few
 *    toots we've sent to see if we should delete our DM. I suspect this is inefficient because we
 *    only get ~20 of our most recent DMs. I think it'd be more efficient to keep a list of statuses
 *    we've replied to in memory instead of loading the server.
 * 2. `search` and `warnTootedUncaptioned` because this is a proposed way to detect whether a boost
 *    lacking image captions has been edited.
 * 3. `relationships` because this will be used to detect STOP requests to unfollow (see #14)
