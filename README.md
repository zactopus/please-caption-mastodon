# Please Caption Mastodon Bot

Based on [a bot I used to use on Twitter called Please Caption](https://twitter.com/pleasecaption). It would message you when you forgot to put text descriptions (also know as 'alt text' or 'captions').

The difference with this bot is as you can send direct messages to statuses (toots) on Mastodon you can have a less spammy bot that messages privately.

Mastodon also lets you 'Delete & re-draft' toots so you can easily add the text descriptions back in.

## How does the bot work?

You can [follow the bot on @PleaseCaption@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@PleaseCaption).

When you post any media (images and videos) without text descriptions it will respond with a message.

## Installing the bot

1. Install dependancies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a Mastodon application and get the access token
> You can do this from the settings in Mastodon. There's a 'Development' section. Give the bot all permissions.


3. Add environment variables
